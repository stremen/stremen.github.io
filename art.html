A lot of work still to be done, but a few lists are available in
a preliminary state.
Now watch it:
these list are large files (~350 kbyte), so downloading may take
some time.

<B>FMR</B> was a bi-monthly magazine dedicated to art.
It is of Italian origin and named 
after its creator and first and long time editor Franco Maria Ricci, but also
appearing in English 
(the edition which I have and is indexed above).
It was taken over by the FMR spa/ART'E' group, so logically:-) after 127 issues it started again with
issue 1 in June 2004.
It produced another 33 issues and maybe another 10 so-called white issues and then
ceased to exist in 2009.
(It seems that I still have to update the index to #33 and the FMR White's:-)
The listed web site does not seem to have any reference any more to the journal
