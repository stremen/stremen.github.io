<P>
Since around 2010, my interests have extended to metal working, and I
have now a nice lathe (well, actually 2) and a very decent milling machine.
I have taken a subscription to Model Engineer Workshop, as I am not
a trained hobbyist in metal working.

</P>
The above links provide indexes only.
If you would like to have the articles or back issues themselves,
you will need to contact the publisher at
<A HREF="http:////www.model-engineer.co.uk">MEW</A>
or better, take a (digital) subscription, which gives
access to all previous issues of MEW (although quality
of the digital issues could well be improved upon!)

</P>
My subscription started at #169 (November 2010), but my
index includes earlier work on the MEW index from
<A HREF="http://www.colinusher.info/Model%20Engineering%20Indexes/mewindex.html">Colin Usher</A>,
(who stopped after #190) and combined his work with the other
index from
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/ajz6me2">Derry</A>,
who also stopped after #190.
I am very much indebted to Colin and Derry,
their indices are a very useful resource for the earlier and very interesting
articles in MEW.
Combining the 2 indexes into my index system has been a work of slow progress;
many duplications between the 2 sources needed to be removed, some categories changed,
but also the format I used is
different because I wanted to have the MEW index fit into the same format as my other
lists.
As a result,
my current index from
1-180 is mostly a combination of the work of Colin and Derry while from 190 onwards
the index is my contribution.
<P>
In adapting MEW to my exisisting format, I faced the problem that not all issues
of MEW had a specific month allocated (I use the numbers 1-12 for this).
Some were called "Winter" or "Christmas";
in the early years there were less than 12 issues in the year;
but there have also been years with more than 12 issues.
I have allocated these "winter" etc issues a specific month number.
But
when there were more than 12 issues in the year,
I had to use
duplicated month numbers.
In short: only the issue number is unique!
So be it.
