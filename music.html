An index of publications, dedicated to musical instruments.
Some files are largish, say up to 1Mb, so if you are on a
slow connection, it may take a little while to download.

The above links provide indexes only.
If you would like to have the articles or back issues themselves,
you will need to contact the publisher.

</P>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.galpinsociety.org"><B>Galpin Society</B></A>
has its own web site.
It has also an index (from which I have borrowed its layout) and a subscription form
for membership.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.fomrhi.org/"><B> FoMRHI</B></A>
the Fellowship of Makers and Researchers of Historical Instruments, is alive again.
It has even its own web site.

After the retirement of the Founding Fathers Jeremy Montagu  (Honorary
Secretary) and Ephraim Segerman (Honorary Editor) in July 2000
with the 100th FoMRHI Quarterly with in total 1726 Communications,
the Quarterly rapidly declined
under a new Secretary and Editor and stopped completely
(without any announcement at all) after the combined 107-108
Quarterly in July 2002.
A pity!
</P>
<P>
But FoMRHI wasn't dead, it was only in hibernation!
In July 2008 Chris Goodwin
(the secretary of the
<A HREF="http://www.lutesoc.co.uk/"> Lute Society </A>
sent out an information to all known members
that he intended to revive FoMRHI after 6 years of silence.
The plan was to publish one or two issues of the Quarterly
with material still available, but he was looking for new
publications.
If you are interested to join,
contact Chris Goodwin at 
<A HREF="mailto:secretary@lutesociety.org"> his email address </A>.
<P> 
FoMRHI is still healthy
and is up to Quarterly 142 issued July 2018.
Look for more information at
<A HREF="http://www.fomrhi.org/"> FoMRHI's web site </A>.
<P>
FoMRHI is an informal publication with membership distribution only.
It used to be difficult to find copies of the Quarterly and the
articles (called Communications) in libraries.
However, all prevous Quarterlies have been scanned and members can freely
download all Quarterlies in PDF format from 
<A HREF="http://www.fomrhi.org/"> FoMRHI's web site </A>.
But also non-members can download all, except for the last 4 current issues.
<P>
FoMRHI's web site has become a complete
web site with all information, including the papers and indexes, in fact making
my index obsolete.
I recommend just to go to
<A HREF="http://www.fomrhi.org/"> FoMRHI's web site </A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Early Music</B> is a quarterly magazine published by the Oxford University Press and more information
can be found on its <A HREF="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/">web site</A>.
I have discontinued its subscription as from January 2007;
my main interests are in the instruments (especially woodwind)
and Early Music has shifted more and more to (very) theoretical articles
about many other aspects of music, which did not interest me really.
</P>
<P> 
Last, but not least, is the <B>Bouwbrief</B> (in Dutch), a quarterly publication of the
"Bouwerskontakt" of "Huismuziek, Vereniging voor Samenspel en Instrumentenbouw"
(formely know as "de Vereniging voor Huismuziek").
The first "Bouwbrief" appeared in 1975 under editorship and initiative of the late Toon Moonen.
152 bouwbrieven have appeared since at the time
of this writing (March 2014) and the
"Bouwerskontakt" is still an active organisation, with many "bouwgroepen"
(chapters) dedicated to specific instruments, which join regularly to discuss
all kind of aspects of their instruments.
Issues 1-144 of the Bouwbrieven have been put on a DVD, which can be
bought from the <A HREF="http://www.huismuziek.nl/">Huismuziek</A>,
or via <A HREF="http://www.bouwerskontakt.nl/">Bouwerskontakt's own web site</A>
(both only in Dutch).
