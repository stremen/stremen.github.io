<B>Fine WoodWorking</B> is published bi-monthly by the Taunton
Press in the USA.
All contact information can be found on the web site of

My subscription started at #19 (November 1979), but the index
also lists #1, #2, and #3.
In fact, these refer to the 3 books published by Taunton,
called "Fine Woodworking Techniques".
The first volume contained articles from FWW 1-7.
Volume 2 covered 8-13, while the 3rd volume included FWW 14-19.

I found <B>American Woodworker</B> interesting until it was taken over by
Reader Digest, so I stopped it.

<P>
Since June 2008, (i.e. #169), I had a subscription to
<B>Popular Woodworking</B> as well
which I found a rather interesting magazine.
However there were just too many journals to read
and I stopped PWW in April 2016.
Fine Woodworking suited me best.
Popular Woodworking is published by F+W Publications Inc.
and their web site is
<A HREF="http://www.popularwoodworking.com/ppwhomepage/">PWW</A>.
