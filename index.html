<HR>



Born in the great city of
<A
HREF="http://www.maastricht.nl">
	Maastricht</A>, famous for its beauty and character,
	the "Treaty of Maastricht", the
	language
<A HREF="http://li.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestreechs">
	 "ut Mestreechs</A>" and, of course, the yearly
<A HREF="https://www.gemeentemaastricht.nl/english/sport-culture/carnaval-carnival-carnivale-in-maastricht/">
	Carnival</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.tempeleers.nl/">
	"vastelaovend vereiniging de Tempeleers"</A>, but living in
<A HREF="http://www.amsterdam.nl/">
Amsterdam</A> since long.
<P>
Both are actually great cities of
the Netherlands, or 
Holland,
its more familiar but incorrect name.

<P>

Formerly working at the European Space Research and Technology Centre,
ESTEC
	in

ESTEC is the largest centre of the

	European Space Agency ESA</A>.

<P>
Interests and hobbies are but a few, but nevertheless can take quite
some time.
I keep track of a couple of indexes to periodicals in these
domains.
They include:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="music.html">Music</A>, especially early music in authentic
performances (Early Music, FoMRHI Quarterly, the
Galpin Society Journal and the Dutch Bouwbrief of the Dutch association
het Bouwerskontakt;
<LI>
<A HREF="art.html">Art</A>, with a preference for sculptures, and the
Italian renaissance (FMR).
<LI>
<A HREF="woodworking.html">Woodworking</A> on a small scale
(Fine Woodworking, American Woodworker and since short, also Popular Woodworking).
<LI>
<A HREF="metalworking.html">Metalworking</A> since a few years
(Model Engineer Workshop).
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
All my indexes are maintained with
<A HREF="https://www.bitrot.de/">grok</A>
(many thanks to Thomas Driemeyer), and they are now all in the same basic
format.
Unfortunately, grok seems no longer maintained by Thomas,
so I keep my fingers crossed.
From the basic 'grok' file format it is
quite easy to generate CSV files (comma separated value files)
and you can download these CSV files for use in your own spreadsheet from the 
<A HREF="downloads">download area</A> *).
(You may need to use shift-button_1 click on the file name to start the download, rather then to see the files.)
Although the website use proper html code for accented characters, such as
'&amp;agrave;' for '&agrave;', the CSV files are converted to the UTF-8 character set.
<P>
*) Unfortunately, the site on github does not show the list of csv files available in directory "downloads"
as used to be the case.
If you are desperate you still can download any specific csv file by specifying its name iin your browser as https://stremen.github.io/<i>xxx</i>_utf8.csv where "<i>xxx</i>" is the character name of the particular subject of interest (aww, bbb, emm, fmr, fomrhi, fww, galpin, mew or pww).  Look at the url when browsing your subject.
But I am looking for a good solution.
